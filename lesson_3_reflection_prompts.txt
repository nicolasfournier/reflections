When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
it makes it possible to share work with others, with myself when I am working on a different computer, and provides me with a backup, in case something goes horribly wrong locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If other users work on the same project, any of their changes could lead to unexpected effects

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branches are working inside a repository and allow me to try out different modifications without affecting a main branch.  cloning and forking is rather used on repositories (not within) to create a copy, where fork is used to make a copy that is intended to live on independently of the original, while clone is rather used to have a local copy of a repository to work on, while the synchronised version is on the server.
