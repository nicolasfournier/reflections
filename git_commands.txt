git commands
---------------

git init
creates an empty .git subdirectory in my current directory

git clone http://github.org/udacity/asteroids.git
gets the repository of asteroids from some remote source and stores it in the local .git directory.  It includes the entire history of commits and allows me to travel back in time through the version history of that repository.  I don't have to run git init first.

git diff <commitIDnumber1> <commitIDnumber2>
compares the files between two commited versions of a project
git diff
compares the files in the working directory to those in the staging area
git diff --staged
compares the files in the staging area to the files in the last commit (the commit I currently have checked out)

git show <commitID>
shows the changes introduced by a commit in comparison to its parent (which might not be the commit listed chronologically before it, in the case when several branches have been merged together because the commits of different merged branches are interleaved and sorted by time, so doing a diff between chronologically consecutively listed commits is not necessarily the same as a diff between a branch and its parent)

git log --stat
shows statistics on changes for each version.  The most recent is shown first! 

git status

git checkout <commitIDnumber1>
retrieve a certain commited version from the repository to work on it.  If I don't work on the latest version, I should probably create a branch.

git checkout -b <branchname>
automatically creates a new branch with the name branchname, and then checks it out.

git add <filename>
adds filename to the staging area, which is a sort of directory that contains all files that will be added to the next commit.  Sounds a bit tedious.  if I later change the file I need to add it again otherwise an old version gets commited.  I would prefer if git worked out by itself what has changed and always used the latest version of my files.

git branch
shows me the currently available branches
git branch <branchname>
creates a new branch with the given name using the currently checked-out version

git remote [-v]
shows me the currently available remote repositories
git remote add <remotename> <location>
create a new remote repository with name remotename, and a internet location 
git push <remotename> <branchnametopush>
pushes the branch onto the remote repository

git fetch <remotename>
retrieves updates from the remote repository as a branch, without automatically merging, to allow comparing and manual merging.  The new branch is called <remotename>/<branchname>  (i.e. often: "origin/master"). It is also a much faster way to retrieve updates from the remote, as it allows delaying the interactive merging.

git pull <remotename> <branchname>
is a concatenation of "git fetch <remotename>" and "git merge <branchname> <remotename>/<branchname>" 

GitHub functionalities
---------------
create new files
fork repositories: it create a clone of the forked project under my own github account, giving me freedom to change it however I want it, while still giving some credit to the original project author.
