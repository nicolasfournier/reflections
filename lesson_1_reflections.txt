the diff helped quickly find changes and not getting mixed up between the two files

Version control is essential to allow branching and trying things out without loosing old work at some stable point.  it also ensures that progress can be documented.

manually having to decide when to commit has the advantage of allowing me to choose a good point oin time after a logical unit of work has been done.  I can then also add comments to document it.  The automated versioning allows neither.  However, from experience I know that I tend not to take the time to either create versions regularly nor to write comments.

It is essential to store at the same time all files that are related to a project.  It eases going back to a consistent version of the entire project. This is due to the fact that a programming project is normally split across files.  It is in the nature of a software project to be split across files, just as other documents have cvhapters.  The project and each file therein however only makes sense in conjunction with the other files.   Google docs does not need this as normally text documents are self contained. 

The checkout command allows me to go back to an old version of the code.  I should probably commit whatever I have currently worked on.  That way I can always come back to it.  Going back to an older version allows me to determine when a bug was introduced, and narrow down the location of the bug. This should make bug-fixing quite easy, if it can be reproduced easily. The correction should however be performed on the most recent version.

Also git makes it easy to try out new things without risk, as it is easy to go back to a stable version.
